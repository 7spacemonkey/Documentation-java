                <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming
                    language. It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the
                    development of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it</p>
                <p>JavaScript is a weakly typed language (dynamically typed). JavaScript can be used for Client-side
                    developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript is both an imperative and declarative
                    type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and
                    a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Client-side:-</b> It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model
                        (DOM). Like if client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and
                        respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. Useful libraries
                        for the client side are AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS, and so many others.</li>
                    <li><b>Server-side:-</b> It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For if the
                        server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, and provide
                        continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file
                        manipulations on a server. The useful framework which is the most famous these days is node.js.

                        Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on

            <h2>Javascript and java</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    JavaScript and Java
                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                    JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
                    JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs
                    which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                    runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
                    values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object
                    model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
                    for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
                    requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
                <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                    classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                    protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return
                    types are not explicitly typed.</p>

        <section id="Hello_world">
            <h2>Hello world</h2>
            <article>
                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
                    JavaScript code:</p>
                <code>
                    function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); } <br> greetMe("World");
                </code>
                <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section id="Variables">
            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <article>
                <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                    identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
                <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                    characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                    characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
                <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the
                    Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits,
                    temp99, and _name.</p>
